## Product Strategy Manager

Hello, welcome to my webpage.

I don't think you've come all the way here just to read another version of my resumé.[^1]  Therefore, instead of listing what I have achieved throughout my educational and professional life. I'd like to break this journey down into some of my core values and philosophies that guide me through my life.

### *Shokunin Kishitsu*
Known as the Japanese craftsman's spirit, *shokunin kishitsu*, symbolizes the hard work and dedeication of Japanese artisans who devote their lives to create delicate crafts and arts. I take the craftsmanship as the epitome of good work, which also semi-formalizes my own working style. I enjoy hands-on work to create, innovate and deliver, which is also why I'm always into developing my hands-on skillsets, from understanding the principles of statistics and quantitative analysis[^2] to using Python and R for data cleaning and drawing insights[^3], from learning Agile product management methodologies to using Scrum framework to guide prodcut development work.

### Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.
Albeit being a bit cliché now, I do closely resonate with this quote. When I graduated from my bachelor's study, I thought of myself being invincible as the younger self thought he knew everything out there in the world. However, the more I ponder about the philosophy, the more I realized how ignorant have I been. Ever since then, I have embarked on a journey of learning.[^4] Visting different places, working at different industries and meeting different people have all been the ways I try to learn about the world we live in. Through these interactions, I've learnt to keep an open mind and developed a taste for diversity. In turn, it has also made me particularly good at working with a diverse community, listening to the needs of various stakeholders, and achieving alignment.

### Judging vs Perceiving
Everyone's obessession with [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers–Briggs_Type_Indicator) has gotten me into testing out where I sit on this personality spectrum multiple times.[^5] One thing I did notice from my tests throughout the years is that I tend to shift between [J and P](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting). This got me into thinking how it has reflected my M.O. in real life. I think the best way to categorize it is that I tend to hone in on the long-term vision while staying nimble with execution. No matter at work or in life, I would have a long term goal set and build everything around it to support it litte by little. Though sometimes circumstances change, I also keep it flexible for worthy alternatives. As such, I am person who puts a priority on strategic planning and roadmapping while ensuring the implementation could be nimble enough to be carried out.
